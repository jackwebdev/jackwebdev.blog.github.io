* FreeCodeCamp had updated their entire website and added a load of new content to the curriculum. I had already spent some time but never completed the first section. I continue to work through the new Responsive Web Design curriculum.
* Completed the Basic CSS section (finished up the new challenges added).
* Completed the Applied Visual Design section. 
* Completed the Applied Accessibility section. - This section has opened my eyes to be aware of how I design and create the structure of a website with accessibility in mind.
* Completed the CSS Flexbox section.
* Completed the CSS Grid section.
* Responsive Web Design Projects Section.
- Re-uploaded the tribute page. (My first ever major project created late 2017)
- Started to create the Survey For which I plan to submit tomorrow. 
- Re-uploaded the Personal Portfolio page. (My first attempt of the portfolio in late 2017)
* Created my new blog after seeing inspiration on twitter with learning web development.
