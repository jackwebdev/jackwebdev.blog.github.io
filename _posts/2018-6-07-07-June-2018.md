+ Rebuilt my SpaceX Mission Data.
 - Older version: [SpaceX Mission Data V1](https://codepen.io/JackTheWebDev/full/erKmpX).
 - Newest version: [SpaceX Misison Data V2](https://jackwebdev.github.io/SpaceX-Mission-Data/)
 
I decided to rebuild this web app from only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I didn't use any Jquery or Bootstrap as I wanted to get to know pure JavaScript and CSS/Flexbox better. I did use [ParticlesJS](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) to create the moving background and continued to take data using this [SpaceX api](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API).

I have found it challenging to make this side projects although every project I build I gain far more experience and how to quickly assemble aspects of the websites.
