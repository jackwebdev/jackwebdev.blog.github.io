+ Continued reading through Eloquent JavaScript 3rd Edition Book
 
### My attempts at the Eloquent JavaScrip program structure excersies. 
You can copy the code and run it [on this website](https://repl.it/languages/javascript).
#### Looping a triangle.
```javascript
let hash = "#";
for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++){
  console.log(hash.repeat(hash.length + i));
}
//Output Below:
//#
//##
//###
//####
//#####
```

#### FizzBuzz
```javascript
for(let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  let num = i;

  if(num % 3 === 0 && num % 5 === 0 ){
    console.log(`${num} is FizzBuzz`);
  } else if (num % 3 === 0) {
    console.log(`${num} is Fizz`);
  } else if(num % 5 === 0) {
    console.log(`${num} is Buzz`);
  } else {
    console.log(`${num}`);
  }
}
```
#### Chessboard
This challenge I found difficult and my first attempt was to simplify my current understanding on how to generate the basic grid of 8 rows. This solution doesn't allow the width of each row to be dynamic as they're hardcoded into the "row1" and "row2" variables. 

##### Attempt 1
```javascript
let gridSize = 8;
gridSize = gridSize / 2;
let row1 = "# # # #";
let row2 = " # # # # "
for(let i = 0; i < gridSize; i++) {
  console.log(row1);
  console.log(row2);
}

This 2nd attempt took me a while to figure out. With my understanding from the Attempt 1 solution, I was able to figure out how to generate the grid dynamically with Google being my friend! I have commented the code to explain how each step works. 

```
##### Attempt 2
```javascript
//Change the number to make the grid larger or smaller.
let size = 8;

//Empty string for storage
let chessBoard = "";

//Outer loop crates the new lines for each rows.
for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
  //Inside loop creates the rows matching the variable sizes.
  for(let j = 0; j < size; j++){
    if((i + j) % 2 == 0) {
      chessBoard += " "
    } else {
      chessBoard += "#"
    }
  }
  chessBoard += "\n";
}
//Print to the console the full chessBoard string
console.log(chessBoard);
```
