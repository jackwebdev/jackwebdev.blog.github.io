+ Refactored some areas of the code and changed Web UI elements to the [SpaceX - Mission Data App](https://jackwebdev.github.io/SpaceX-Mission-Data/)
  - Added shooting stars.
  - Changed the entire layout from Flexbox to a masonary grid. I now use the following library to handle the grid/items [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com).
