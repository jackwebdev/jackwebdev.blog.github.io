### My attempts at the Eloquent JavaScrip Function excersies. 
You can copy the code and run it [on this website](https://repl.it/languages/javascript). 

#### Minimum function - Return the minium from 2 arguments.
```javascript
function min(x, y){
  return Math.min(x, y);
}
min(1, 2);
//Output Below:
//1working
```

#### Recursion function - Return a boolean (true/false) result if the number is even. % (remainder operator) Not allowed.
This exercise was challenging. To understand this problem I needed to do more research online on how Recursion worked.

The code will do checks using a conditional IF statement. The idea of Recursion is to invoke the same function inside its self create a loop. The loop will either add or subtract the argument depending on its value for example; the number 75 will keep subtracting 2 until it reaches either 0 or 1. When the numbers reach 0 or 1 the IF conditional statement is called. If the result ends in 0, it will output true (it's even)! Otherwise if it ends in 1 it will output false (it's odd).

It appears simple, but understanding the concept was key in solving this challenge. 

```javascript
function isEven(num) {
  if(num === 0) {
    return true;
  } else if (num === 1){
    return false;
  } else if (num < 0) {
    return isEven(num + 2);
  } else {
    return isEven(num - 2)
  }
}
//Output below:
//isEven(1); false
//isEven(2); true
//isEven(50); true
//isEven(75); false

//isEven(-1); false
//isEven(-2); true
//isEven(-50); true
//isEven(-75); false
```
