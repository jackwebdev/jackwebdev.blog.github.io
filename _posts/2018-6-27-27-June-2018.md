+ Continued reading through Eloquent JavaScript 3rd Edition Book.
+ Updated [SpaceX - Mission Data App](https://jackwebdev.github.io/SpaceX-Mission-Data/) to include CSS loading animation to allow enough time for the grid to generate and load to avoid grid items overlapping on rare occasions. The loading animation helps keep the user engaged and avoids them thinking the website is taking a few seconds to load.
