##Hello World

This blog was created on the 3rd June 2018. Its main purpose is to log my progress while learning Web Development. This blog will allow me to document my new learnings and to keep track of my learning goals.  

The posts below are FAQ of what my goals are and how the blog will be used.

## What is my previous web development experience? ##

I remember being as young as 12 when I first got into creating video-game blogs using Google's Blogspot (now Google Blogger) software. The earliest blog I created was for a popular game called Club Penguin where I would blog about the latest game news and cheats. This is where I started to understand the foundations by editing the basic HTML of the blog. As I got older my main focuses were school and I lost interest in maintaining that blog. I wasn't aware at the time but I had learned many skills from that blog. During my early secondary school years, I created a public Minecraft server, this is where I got more in-depth with creating the websites for the small community of gamers.

Finishing up from secondary school and moving to college... I always wanted to learn and get more in-depth with coding, I always loved video-games and technology, so I decided to take a computer games development course. Sadly, this course didn't cover the basics or fundamentals and I feel it was a waste of my time. I finished the course with high grades, but I still didn't have the know-how or knowledge to create a video game! I realised that no school will help me. It wasn't until late Nov, 2017 I started to research and aim to self-teach myself. I came across FreeCodeCamp's website where I started the curriculum from very basic HTML knowledge and from then on It has sparked my learning. 

## What am I hoping to achieve? ##
My main goal is to achieve a carrier in Web Development field. To achieve this I will teach my self-using the web! I have already covered many hours of time from watching and producing small projects from FreeCodeCamp, YouTube and FreeCodeCamp.

## How am I going to learn? ##
I have already found some great resources and guides on how to learn Web Development. 

Current resources I am using:
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)
* [My FreeCodeCamp Progress](https://www.freecodecamp.org/portfolio/jackwebdev)
* YouTube - I am watching content on YouTube to help learn more.
* [The Web Developer Bootcamp -  By Colt Steele - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/)
*[The Complete JavaScript Course 2018 - By 
Jonas Schmedtmann - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/v4/overview)


I am able to study most days of the week and several hours on the weekends.

## What is the future of this blog? ##

I wish I had started my blog sooner but now is a good time to start. This blog will help me aim to keep details of my learning progress going forward, I believe that this is the best way for me to keep track of what I have covered.
