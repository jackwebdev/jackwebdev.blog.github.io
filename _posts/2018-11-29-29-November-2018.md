+ I redesigned and created a wordpress theme for a buisness website. The project took no more than 5 days. The main pages are hard coded apart from the blog. This was all very new as I had never created a custom theme before. Depsite not knowing very much PHP I was able to find tutorials and guides online to add in basic PHP sections for wordpress.
